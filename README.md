#### Global Biodiversity Decline



We are living in a time of ecological crisis. Scientists have identified that we are very likely in the 6th mass extinction in the history of earth, signaled by an incredibly rapid rate of species extinction (Barnosky, Anthony D., et al) compared with our fossil records. Not only are we seeing extinctions, we are also seeing massive population and range declines nearly across the board; some have gone as far as to call it a “Biological Annihilation” (Ceballos et al). This global decimation of species and the resulting destruction of biodiversity has wide reaching effects ____



Biodiversity is, at surface level, quite simply variety and variability of life. It is generally viewed at three levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Genetic biodiversity is the amount of gene variation within a given species. A great example of this is dogs, who are members of the Canis lupus species, but whose genetic diversity can be seen in the phenotypic diversity of the ~450 different recognized breeds. Infact, dogs are the most variable mammals on earth. Next, species biodiversity is characterized by the number of different species within an ecological community. This could be seen as synonymous with species richness, although species biodiversity measures can include species evenness, which is the relative abundances of species in a community. Figure 1 shows plots of bird, mammal and amphibian richness throughout the world. Finally, ecosystem biodiversity is the variation of ecosystems within a given geographical location. 

The current worldwide extinction rate among all species is estimated to be 100 times higher than the historical baseline (Ceballos, Gerardo, et al, 2015). In North America alone, researchers have shown a net loss of 3 billion birds, or 29% of population levels since just 1970 (Rosenberg, Kenneth V., et al, 2019). This is catastrophic. Biodiversity is at the core of our world; all species are part of natural feedback systems within their ecological environments which facilitates the continuing function of that ecosystem. When a major disruption happens, that feedback system may compound the effect. Take for example the sea otter population of our west coast. Sea otters are a predator of sea urchins, and when sea otters were hunted near to extinction for the fur trade in the 1800s, sea urchin populations boomed. The sea urchins then took over the undersea kelp forests, eating so much of them that they nearly disappeared, along with all of the species that depended on the kelp (Estes, James E., et al 1978). Fortunately sea otter populations have since been reintroduced and kelp forests have begun regrowing, but this is just one example of the effect of the near loss of a species. It’s difficult to even imagine the effect of the modern global extinction. 

As one might imagine, humans are the cause of this sixth extinction. Through deforestation, large scale farming operations and urban expansion, we’re slowly destroying natural habitat throughout the world. We’ve also been prolific in introducing species into ecosystems where they would have never normally existed, causing havoc. Even just our mammalian housepets, dogs and cats, account for a large number of species extinctions XXXXXXXXX. 

Of course, climate change is another major factor, physically altering ecosystems globally. Alongside climate change is the issue of pollution, which chokes the air with smog, fills streams and rivers with toxic chemicals and farm runoff, and covers the earth and the ocean with trash.  Finally, there’s the issue of overharvesting, wherein we’ve simply killed off entire populations of species, be it cod, bluefin tuna or the aforementioned sea otters.

This article characterizes the effect of reduced biodiversity on both the ecological and the human worlds. In terms of the ecosystem, the article explores the resulting decline in resilience and alteration of ecosystem processes caused by the mass extinction of species around the world. On the human side, the article brings light to the social effects of reduced biodiversity. While the article mentions cultural effects, it focuses on the significant economic cost of reduced biodiversity in an attempt to quantify the effect. Finally, the article suggests a set of blueprints by which the scientific community can take action. 


Global Biodiversity Scenarios for the Year 2100

Sala, O. E., Chapin, F. S., Armesto, J. J., Berlow, E., Bloomfield, J., Dirzo, R., ... & Leemans, R. (2000). Global biodiversity scenarios for the year 2100. science, 287(5459), 1770-1774.

http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/287/5459/1770

As a function of atmospheric CO2, climate, vegetation, land use, and the sensitivity of different biomes to changes in the aforementioned data points, this article maps out possible different scenarios for global biodiversity in 2100. Three models are explored, wherein there is no interactions, antagonistic interactions, or synergistic interactions between the causes of biodiversity change. In all scenarios, biodiversity is drastically reduced across all biomes, and especially so in grasslands and Mediterranean ecosystems.



Invasive predators and global biodiversity loss.

Doherty, Tim S., et al. "Invasive predators and global biodiversity loss." *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 113.40 (2016): 11261-11265.

This article examines the effect of invasive species on decline in global biodiversity. The article directly links invasive species as part of the cause of extinction for over 140 different species, and as a distinct threat for ~600 more species. Cats, rodents, dogs, and pigs are stated as the greatest threatening invasive species. The article also examines the types of species that are the most susceptible to damage by invasive populations. 




#### Case Study: Coral Reef Decline

Global Trajectories of the Long-Term Decline of Coral Reef Ecosystems

Pandolfi, John M., et al. "Global trajectories of the long-term decline of coral reef ecosystems." Science 301.5635 (2003): 955-958.

This article takes a centuries long look at degradation of coral reef ecosystems. Carnivores, herivores and architectural species from 14 regions were tracked back through recorded history to provide a macro-level view of reef health throughout time. It was found that all reefs have gone through massive degradation, with some areas of degradation more quickly accelerated than others. It was also found that our current initial markers of degradation (bleaching, coral disease) are infact late stage indicators of coral biodiversity decline, with substantial degradation occuring much prior to these indicators. The article concludes with the definite statement that reefs will not survive without immediate intervention at a global scale.


Climate Change, Human Impacts, and the Resilience of Coral Reefs

Hughes, Terry P., et al. "Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs." science 301.5635 (2003): 929-933.

This article critically examines the trends found in recent (to 2003) publications on reef decline, and confirms that reefs will suffer greatly in the coming years. However, this article suggests that instead of disapear, reefs will adapt to the new environment, and their success of adaptation could be tied to the rate of change of the environment. The conclusion from the above article is echoed; intervention to support reefs is required, along anti-climate-change action

#### Individual Action

The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions

Wynes, Seth, and Kimberly A. Nicholas. "The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions." Environmental Research Letters 12.7 (2017): 074024.

This article critically examined all of the ways in which individuals could lower their carbon footprint over their lifetime, and provides a clear view of which actions have the most impact. These actions are having one fewer child, living car-free, avoiding airplane travel, and eating a plant-based diet, with having one fewer child as the most effective action by an order of magniture. The article discusses how some less effective methods are more prevalent in our culture as "green." The article also discusses the other individual benefits of following these actions. 



Reducing meat consumption in developed and transition countries to counter climate change and biodiversity loss: a review of influence factors

Stoll-Kleemann, Susanne, and Uta Johanna Schmidt. "Reducing meat consumption in developed and transition countries to counter climate change and biodiversity loss: a review of influence factors." Regional Environmental Change 17.5 (2017): 1261-1277.



This article directly ties individual action to countering biodiversity loss, with the focus being reducing meat consumption. The article describes the issue of biodiversity loss and its link to climate change, and identifies reduced meat eating as a way to reduce greenhouse emissions. Finally, the article identifies cognitive dissonance as one of the greatest influences on individual behavior and identifies it as a key challenge point in shifting culture away from meat consumption.
