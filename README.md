This article characterizes the effect of reduced biodiversity on both the ecological and the human worlds. In terms of the ecosystem, the article explores the resulting decline in resilience and alteration of ecosystem processes caused by the mass extinction of species around the world. On the human side, the article brings light to the social effects of reduced biodiversity. While the article mentions cultural effects, it focuses on the significant economic cost of reduced biodiversity in an attempt to quantify the effect. Finally, the article suggests a set of blueprints by which the scientific community can take action. 


Global Biodiversity Scenarios for the Year 2100

As a function of atmospheric CO2, climate, vegetation, land use, and the sensitivity of different biomes to changes in the aforementioned data points, this article maps out possible different scenarios for global biodiversity in 2100. Three models are explored, wherein there is no interactions, antagonistic interactions, or synergistic interactions between the causes of biodiversity change. In all scenarios, biodiversity is drastically reduced across all biomes, and especially so in grasslands and Mediterranean ecosystems.


#### Case Study: Coral Reef Decline

Global Trajectories of the Long-Term Decline of Coral Reef Ecosystems

Pandolfi, John M., et al. "Global trajectories of the long-term decline of coral reef ecosystems." Science 301.5635 (2003): 955-958.

This article takes a centuries long look at degradation of coral reef ecosystems. Carnivores, herivores and architectural species from 14 regions were tracked back through recorded history to provide a macro-level view of reef health throughout time. It was found that all reefs have gone through massive degradation, with some areas of degradation more quickly accelerated than others. It was also found that our current initial markers of degradation (bleaching, coral disease) are infact late stage indicators of coral biodiversity decline, with substantial degradation occuring much prior to these indicators. The article concludes with the definite statement that reefs will not survive without immediate intervention at a global scale.
